The Device Service defines a set of API to create, monitor and control devices. A device is everything you 
interact with everyday of your life. In the simplest form every device is characterized by a type (e.g dimmer, 
light or alarm) through which the device inherits its properties (e.g status and intensity for a dimmer) and 
functions (e.g. turn on, turn off and set intensity for a dimmer).

demonstrates the desired way to write a spec in this project. To maintain the spec consistent, follow 
these rules.

* Use describe blocks for method names.
* Use context blocks for conditions.
